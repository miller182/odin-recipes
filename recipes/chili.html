        Chili is a hearty and flavorful stew made with ground beef, beans, and tomatoes. It's a popular dish in the United States, especially during the colder months. Chili can be made with a variety of ingredients, including different types of beans, vegetables, and spices. It's typically served with toppings like cheese, sour cream, and green onions. Chili is a great make-ahead dish, as it tastes even better the next day. It can be made on the stovetop, in a slow cooker, or in an Instant Pot.
