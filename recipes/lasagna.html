        Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of pasta, meat sauce, and cheese. It's a hearty and comforting meal that's perfect for feeding a crowd. Lasagna can be made with a variety of fillings, including ground beef, sausage, vegetables, and ricotta cheese. It's typically baked in the oven until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Lasagna is a great make-ahead dish, as it can be assembled in advance and refrigerated until ready to bake.

        <li>1 (15-ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>12 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>3/4 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>  
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook and stir ground beef until brown. Add onions and garlic, and cook until onions are transparent. Add crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, salt, pepper, and parsley. Simmer for about 1 hour, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
